## User Story

```
AS AN employer
YOU WILL view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT you can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

```
This application allows for a "visually appealing" portfolio to launch, and then guide the viewer through the potential employee's previous work samples and contact information.
```
